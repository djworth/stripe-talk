Stripe Talk I gave at PUGIP (on 01/09/2012) - http://meetup.com/pug-ip join :)

To get this running just do the following

1. Rename settings.py.example and pop in your stipe keys (http://stripe.com)
2. pip install -r requirements.txt #probably good idea to use virualenv
3. python web.py
4. open http://localhost:5000
5. retire

Enjoy!
